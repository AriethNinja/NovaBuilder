# NovaBuilder
I am getting kind of tired of Dungeons and Dragons
As much as I love playing table top role playing games
I find Aberrant really fun and I think perfect for the campaign I bought
however, there is 24 freaking kids that need stats, plus NPCs
and building a nova is complicated
So many steps, worth it though.
I wanted to create this, but it's been a few years
I'm not really sure which language I am going to stick around for
C# kinda fits my psudeocode.
